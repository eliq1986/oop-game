# OOP - Game

 Created a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." I used JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard or physical keyboard. I themed this project after the movie Endgame.
